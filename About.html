        <h1 class="but-111"> Executive Profile</h1>
     <div class="about-p">  
<p>I’m a data analyst with a strong foundation in Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau and Power BI. My focus is on transforming complex datasets into actionable insights that drive informed decision-making.
     I specialized in data cleaning, manipulation, and advanced analysis, using my skills to 
    uncover trends and patterns that help businesses optimize strategies and improve performance.</p>
 <p>I honed my data analysis skills through an intensive bootcamp at Generation UK & Ireland, 
    where I gained hands-on experience and deepened my understanding of the tools and techniques needed to excel in Data Science. What excites me most about data analysis is the ability
     to turn raw data into compelling stories that is not only explain what’s happening, but also offer a roadmap for improvement. I’m committed to delivering accurate, insightful,
     and meaningful results that directly contribute to a company’s goals.</p>

<p>I am highly skilled in project management, stakeholder communication, and cross-functional collaboration. 
    Known for creative problem-solving, attention to detail, and the ability to present data stories effectively to diverse audiences. I am also dedicated to continuous learning and professional growth, 
    with a passion for leveraging technology and analytics to create impactful solutions.</p>

     <p>
    In addition to my data analysis work, I have a decent experience in web development and graphic design. 
    Also,I Managed to work on various projects, For instance: Logo designing, Advertising and Promotion videos in order to help bussinesses to grow 20% in over a year time, Bussiness Cards and community flyers. These fields fuel my creativity and allow me to bring a visually engaging perspective to the data I work with. 
    Whether it's crafting intuitive websites or designing impactful visuals, I find that these skills complement
     my analytical mindset, allowing me to approach problems from a unique, multifaceted perspective.
